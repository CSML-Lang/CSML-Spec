## What is DOML?

DOML is simple - it's a markup language akin to JSON/YAML/XML/TOML/.../ with the usability of a language like LUA.

## A quick overview

```C
# Version 0.3
// Construct a new Color
Test : Color {
  RGB = 255, 64, 128,
}

// Constructors do exist
// the parameter names are purely for your own merit, they will check if its possible however (will be possible on most systems)
TheSame : Color::Normalized(r: 1, g: 0.25, b: 0.5) {
  Name = "Bob"
}

// You can also just declare an object without scoping it
Other : Color
Other.Name = "X"

// You can also edit the original Test at any point EITHER by doing
Test.R = 50
// Or by doing
Test.{
  G = 128
}

// You can declare arrays like
ArrayObject : []Color {
  ::Normalized(0.95, 0.55, 0.22){
    Name = "Other", // Trailing commas are always allowed
  },
  // You can still do an empty construction
  ::() {
    RGB = 50, 25, 125,
  },
  // And thus you can leave out the ::()
  {
    RGB = 50, 25, 125,
  },
}

// You can also copy objects by doing
NewObj : Color = Other

// Or can do something like
NewObj.Name = ArrayObject[0].Name

// You can also declare arrays inside object definitions
MyTags : Tags {
  // Note: all have to be of the same type
  SetTags = ["Hello", "Other", "bits", "bobs", "kick"]
  Name = MyTags.GetTags[0] // And indexing them works like you would think
}

// You can declare dictionaries like
// Dictionaries within objects can also be created similarly
MyDictionary : [String : Color] {
  { 
    "Bob" : Color::Normalized(0.5, 1.2, 3.5) {
      Name = "Bob's Color"
    }
  },
}
// No need to keep classes around in this example
# Deinit all
```

When you put this into a parser you'll get something like this; compilers are free to optimise by implementing quick calls and other methods, also almost all compilers suppport adding additional comments to each line to clearly demonstrate what each line does (for when you want to inspect the produced code).  Furthermore the actual IR that you will use won't be in `simple` mode (which is meant mainly for when you want to read/tweak it) since the excessive use of strings is inefficient.

```assembly
; This is the resulting bytecode from the file given
; This bytecode will be overriden if new bytecode is generated.
# IR simple {
  init 4 4 ; Initialises the stack and registers
  ; This is a comment
  ; Construct a new Color
  newobj #Test Color Color
  push int 255, 64, 128
  call #Test Color RGB

  push flt 1, 0.25, 0.5
  newobj #TheSame Color Normalized
  quickpush str "Bob"e
  quickcall #Test Color Name

  newobj Color Color #Other
  quickpush str "X"
  quickcall #Other Color Name

  quickpush int 50
  quickcall #Test Color R

  quickpush int 128
  quickcall #Test Color G

  push flt 0.95, 0.55, 0.22
  newobj #ArrayObject__0 Color Normalized
  quickpush str "Other"
  quickcall #ArrayObject__0 Color Name

  newobj #ArrayObject__1 Color Color
  push int 50, 25, 125
  call #ArrayObject__1 Color RGB

  newobj #ArrayObject__2 Color Color
  push int 50, 25, 125
  call #ArrayObject__2 Color RGB

  copyobj Color Color #NewObj

  quickget #ArrayObject__0 str Color Name
  quickcall #NewObj Color Name

  newobj Tags Tags #MyTags
  push vec str 5
  quickcpy vec str "Hello", "Other", "bits", "bobs", "kick"
  call #MyTags Tags SetTags

  get #MyTags Tags GetTags
  quickgetindex vec str 0
  pop 1 ; ^^ the array will get popped not ^^ as ^^ is a quick call and goes to a separate register.
  quickcall #MyTags Tags Name

  push flt 0.5 1.2 3.5
  newobj #MyDictionary__Bob 3 Color Normalized
  quickpush str "Bob's Color"
  quickcall #MyDictionary__Bob Color Name
}
```

## Shortened Format

Sometimes the problem with JSON is that it just bulks up so much and looks very noisy, so DOML provides a few ways to shorten your scripts;

An initial doml script;
```C
Wizard : Character {
  Name = "Wizard the Great",
  Stats = {
    { Character.Stat.HP : 2 },
    { Character.Stat.AP : 9 },
    { Character.Stat.ST : 3 }
    // And so on
  },
  Spells = [
      Spell::Fireball(),
      Spell::New() {
        Name = "Polymorphism",
        EffectScript = "Polymorphism.lua"
      }
  ]
}
```
You could reduce this down to (using the idea of scoping variables)
```C
Wizard : Character {
  Name = "Wizard the Great",
  Stats : [Character.Stat : Int] = { HP : 4 }, { AP : 9 }, { ST : 3 }
  Spells : [Spell] = [Fireball(), New() { Name = "Polymorphism", EffectScript = "Polymorphism.Lua" }]
}
```

## Types

| Type          | Example Values                        | Details (all suffixes are case insensitive)        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Integer       | 12, -40, +2, 01010b, 0x40FF, 0o42310  | 0b for binary, 0x for hex, 0o for octal            |
| Double        | 10.5, 20, 5e+22, 1e6, -2.54E-2        | E for exponent                                     |
| Decimals      | $40, +$99.05, -$4e+22                 | Can use E for exponent and '$' refers to decimal   |
| String        | "This contains a \" escaped quote"    | "...", you can escape `"` with `\`                 |
| Boolean       | true, false                           | The boolean values                                 |
| Object        | Test, X, MyColor                      | Refers to a previously defined object              |

> Note: decimals have standidized for `$` though many parsers will probably allow the various other currency signs.

## Collections


| Type          | Example                               | Details (all suffixes are case insensitive)        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Arrays        | \[1, 2, 3, 4\]                        | All have to be of the same type                    |
| Dictionary    | { { "X" : 2 }, { "Y" : 9 } }          | All keys/values have to be same type (key != value)|

## Actually using objects created

There are a multitude of ways to use the objects i.e. actually give them to the application, often applications have some kind of 'registerX' function that registers the objects so I'll follow that in this example.
```C
// First you could just do it on a base by base basis
Wizard = Character {
  Name = "Wizard the Great",
  Stats : [Character.Stat : Int] = { HP : 4 }, { AP : 9 }, { ST : 3 }
  Spells : [Spell] = [Fireball(), New() { Name = "Polymorphism", EffectScript = "Polymorphism.Lua" }]
}.Register();
// Can also put it on its own line
Wizard.Register();
// Or do the identical call
Character.Register(Wizard); // Presuming that it is a static method
// Or do a localized call (calls Register on all characters)
#LocalizedCall Character Register
// Or just a mass call (calls Register on every object)
#MassCall Register
```

## Serialization

Compilers will support serialization, however they may just support it through a binary serialization (i.e. an outputted DOML IR file which isn't text readable), all 'official' compilers will however support it in any format both binary, text readable and actual 'DOML' output.

## Comparison with other formats

Hopefully the code examples clearly demonstrate DOML's strengths, it is built for programmers as a de-serializable format to enable them to store data efficiently and effectively; it excels at being readable and simple (it's grammar is extremely simple compared to any language out there), while it is similar to markup languages and similar to scripting languages I feel it sits somewhat in the middle, it is as useful as using LUA for your data management but as simple as JSON.

## Get Involved

Anyways, if you have any new changes you may wish to add please ask in the issues!  I will be more cautious to accept PRs if the changes aren't talked about in an issue (though the obvious exception is if you are fixing up typos/errors or if its a super small thing, OR if you are adding your implementation / project to the list all these don't require issues of course).

## Roadmap

- V0.3.

## Projects using DOML

- If you know of any please send a PR adding to this list!

## Version 'Promises'

- Each compiler will support each minor and major version but isn't required to support each patch version.
  - Compilers can ignore this requirement for versions prior to v0.5 however.
- At version 1.0.0, compilers are allowed for the only time to break compatability with previous versions as long as there is a stable 'pre 1.0.0' version (and hopefully maintain in terms of bugs for another year or two), this is to give the project a fresh slate and to prevent the slowdown from having to support multiple different versions.
- Post v1.0.0 compilers have to just support each major version as before but as minor versions aren't allowed to have breaking changes compilers aren't required to support them (since all code written in vX.Y will work in vX.Z providing Z > Y).

## Implementations of DOML

If you have an implementation, send a pull request adding to this list. Please note the version tag that your parser supports in your Readme.

## v0.3 Compatible Compilers

- [C#](https://github.com/DOML-Lang/DOML.net)
  - Currently is about 3/4 complete.

## In Progress

- [C++](https://github.com/DOML-Lang/DOML-Cxx)
  - No progress has started (but it will start soon)
- [Go](https://github.com/DOML-Lang/DOML-GO)
  - Slightly v0.2 compatible but not v0.3 compatible yet.
- [Zig]()
  - Way too many compiler bugs in the way and the language is just not mature enough as it is changing too rapidly.

## Do you have a compiler in a language that you want to work on?

- Go ahead!  I won't make any compiler 'official' (i.e. under the DOML-Lang 'company') till it is finished but it can definitely go on this list till then!  I would like to have most of the compilers under the DOML-Lang banner as it gives them an air of officiality and we can ensure that they are supported for a while.

## Editor Support

> These will be missing a considerable amount of features as the language has recently changed, I'll fix them up when I get time.
- [Notepad++](https://github.com/DOML-Lang/Notepad-Syntax) OUTDATED
- [VIM](https://github.com/DOML-Lang/DOML-VIM) OUTDATED
- [VS-Code](https://github.com/DOML-Lang/vscode-DOML)
- EMACS/Sublime Text/... are all in development (and will be released soonish)
